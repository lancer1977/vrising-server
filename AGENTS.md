# AGENTS.md

## Purpose

This file is the repo-local guide for coding agents working in this repository.
Follow the closest `AGENTS.md` first, then the workspace-root `AGENTS.md` when this repo lives under `~/code`.

## Default Workflow

- Start with understanding first, then planning, then implementation.
- Read the repository `README.md` and any local docs before changing code.
- Check `docs/features/` and `docs/roadmaps/` when they exist.
- Prefer small, traceable changes over broad rewrites.
- Ask a direct question if the work is ambiguous or would require a risky assumption.
- Preserve existing patterns unless there is a strong reason to change them.
- If this repo participates in portfolio monitoring, treat the Dev Forge Work Matrix as the operator-facing control surface; keep repo-local current-work notes short and avoid duplicating portfolio state in multiple places.

## Validation

- Prefer creating or updating unit tests when they are the right validation surface.
- Use repo-native build, test, and lint commands instead of guessing.
- Verify the smallest relevant surface that proves the change.
- If a change affects docs, update the docs and checklists in the same pass.

## Code Standards

- Keep edits focused and reviewable.
- Prefer strongly typed code and explicit boundaries where practical.
- Avoid destructive commands unless explicitly requested.
- Do not revert user changes you did not make.
- Keep secrets and tokens out of source control.

## Docs Standards

- Treat documentation as part of the product.
- Prefer checklist-heavy docs for progress, validation, and follow-up work.
- Record implementation notes when the repo has ongoing feature work.
- When behavior changes, update the relevant feature or roadmap doc before finishing.

## Git Hygiene

- Do not rewrite shared history unless explicitly asked.
- Do not force-push by default.
- Keep the working tree clean enough that future diffs are easy to inspect.

## Repo Notes

- Add repo-specific commands, constraints, and validation steps below this line.
- `DS-vrising` is runtime-only; start with `docs/README.md` and keep support-home ownership in `../vrising-support`.

## Global DevOps GitHub–Kanban Contract

For DevOps, infrastructure, deployment, security, GitOps, and service work:

1. GitHub is authoritative for Issues, PRs, CI, reviews, merges, releases, and delivery state, and is the execution queue.
2. One GitHub Issue should normally produce one PR directly to `main`.
3. Before branch work or a PR, fetch `origin/main` and reconcile against the current remote default branch. Do not build branch-on-branch PR stacks unless an explicit integration owner and final target are stated.
4. Do not merge, deploy, close issues, rotate secrets, or claim production success unless the task explicitly authorizes it and verification evidence exists.
5. If branches diverge, stop merging the stack. Create one integration branch from current `origin/main`, resolve semantic conflicts deliberately, run tests, and open one replacement PR to `main`.
6. For security or infrastructure work, provide exact build, test, and diff evidence and require fresh independent review before merge. Never put secrets in code, logs, PRs, or comments.
7. A task is not complete because a local test passes or a Kanban card says done. Completion requires the requested GitHub state and, when applicable, verified live behavior.
8. When creating a PR, state its target branch, linked issue, validation output, and whether it supersedes prior PRs. Do not leave divergent worker PRs ambiguous.

## Low-Interruption Execution

- Treat explicit outcome requests such as "fix," "build," "complete," and
  "finish" as continuing authorization for bounded work toward that outcome.
- Continue through diagnosis, implementation, tests, commits, pushes, review
  feedback, and CI repair without renewed confirmation.
- New defects discovered within the same task or pull request remain in scope
  when the repair is reversible, clearly supported, and consistent with the
  existing architecture.
- Progress updates are informational and do not pause execution.
- Do not request confirmation when the only realistic alternatives are the
  clearly supported action and inaction.
- Use a blocking checkpoint only at a genuine impasse. Present two or three
  materially different choices as **A**, **B**, and optionally **C**; recommend
  one and ask for a one-letter reply.
- Do not use "Done — continue" as a generic permission gate.
- Preserve explicit approval boundaries for merge, deploy, destructive work,
  secret or access changes, material cost, external communication, and credible
  downtime or data-loss risk.
