## Validation

- `python /home/lancer1977/code/dev-forge/tools/dev_studio_validate.py --repo /home/lancer1977/code/vrising-server` -> All required items found; all recommended items found after this pass.

### Worktree pressure — low
- The repo was clean before this pass.
- The new maintenance artifacts are isolated and do not overlap with unrelated local edits.

### Docs / repo-convention alignment — resolved
- Root `code_health.md` now exists and captures the repo health pass.
- `docs/project-atlas/README.md` now exists as the repo-level project anchor.

### Validation status — healthy
- Dev Studio validation now reports all required and recommended items found.
